AI Chatbot systems can be designed in many different architectures based on user needs and scenario adapatation.

In this section of the page, I tried to create a traditional RAG Based document retriever conversational chatbot, a Hierarchical Mult-agent chatbot, and a RAG-Webscraping fall-back mechanism chatbot ï¼ˆPerforms document search first and falls back to webscraping if source content is not adequate for user query)

## ðŸš€ **Hierarchical Agents - Digital Market Research Team**

ðŸŽ¯ Utilizing CrewAI to create a enterprise-grade (perhaps not yet) digitalized workforce that researches any market, industry, company based on user query.
Returns a downloadable pdf file that gives users an enterprise-grade (again, perhaps not yet) due diligence report on selected topic.

ðŸŽ¯ The workflow is entirely automated by a Manager Agent, who delegates tasks to other agents (i.e. macro researcher, risks analyst, competition intelligence researcher etc) to conduct individual researches and then aggregated together into a comprehensive report.

ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Engineering is the key here to determine the quality of the due diligence report, after undergoing several stages of prompt engineering renovations, it now has the capability to do a relative comprehensive research with relevant soures + hyperlinks included to back up its statements.
Further improvements of this chatbot could either be done by switching models (i.e. gpt-o1), which will be extremely expensive (analogous to hiring top notch talents from the job market), or simply fine-tune the prompt further.
